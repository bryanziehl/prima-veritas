assets — Project Identity Assets

This directory contains the minimal visual identity asset used by the Prima Veritas OSS project.

Only one asset is included:

Color logo with background.svg
The primary Prima Veritas OSS mark, used in the top-level README and in downstream forks or documentation.

Purpose

The SVG is provided solely for:

displaying a consistent project identity in README files

downstream documentation

attribution within forks or derivative works (optional)

Notes

The logo is MIT-licensed along with the rest of the repository.

PNGs, PDFs, or extended branding kits are intentionally not included to keep the OSS distribution lightweight and research-focused.

Projects forking this repository may replace or remove the logo as desired.
